New equipments for the torture rooms are being tested. One of them consists of a pendulum of length L where the pivot allows it to oscillate only in horizontal driven by a motor pinned at height H above the room's window according to the function:

x(t) = Acos(Wt)

The average position of this oscillation is located at a distance D from the window's wall and the gravitational field in the region is G. The corporation wants to determine the absolute value of the angular oscillation frequency of the motor (W) at which the angular acceleration of the pendulum in the moment of the person being thrown (at the position of the window) is maximum.

The input consists of only one line with the aforementioned data separated by spaces, like this:

L H D G

The output must be just one line indicating the answer with 3-digit precision.

**e.g.:**

Input:

2.4 1.1 1.9 9.83

Output:

40.893
