Betrayals in the corporations became so frequent, some of them had torture room built in their facilities. One of the equipments in the room of one of these companies is composed of a spring of relaxed length L that points outside of a window at a Q-degree angle to the vertical. This kind of torture depends on the luck of the tortured to determine if they survive or fly out of the window.

The tortured sits in a metal chair positioned at the endpoint of the spring (consider the spring is not deformed by the weight of tortured+chair). The spring is then compressed until it reaches null length (assume this is possible without damaging the spring) and then released. At this moment two things might happen: the tortured gets launched (along with the chair) or the chair gets stuck to the spring and the tortured oscillates in and out of the room's window (assume the only deformation in the spring is along it's shaft). In case the person gets launched out of the window, the company wants them to be launched at a very specific region, which is located at position (XF,YF) starting from the endpoint of the relaxed spring (which coincides with the position of the window), both axes being horizontal and aligned to the ortogonal walls of the room. Also (the room was planned for this), they want the tortured to get to their destination with the vertical component of velocity equal to V (pointing down).

Still, they're worried if the oscillation frequency in case the tortured gets stuck to the spring will be as torturing as they want it to be. They need your help to calculate the angular oscillation frequency in case the tortured is lucky enough to get stuck to the spring.

Let the gravitational field in this region be G and for a person(along with the chair), the ratio between the absolute value of the air resistance force and the absolute value of the velocity in any instant is B. All units used in the input are S.I. units, and so must be the output.

The input for this problem is composed of all the parameters mentioned in the text, in the order that they appear, in one line separated by spaces, that is:

L Q XF YF V G B

The output must be composed of only one line containing the answer for the problem given in the text, with 3-digit precision.

**e.g.:**

Input:

6 53 6359 8572 74 9.78 5

Output:

2208.608
