We have discovered a game used by BloodSuckers to recruit new members for their Intelligence sector. Your mission is **to automate a solution** (bot) to win it, **staying alive for 137 seconds**. Soon we'll try to infiltrate more RF members in BSC, and you might just be the next!

For latency reasons, first access the **Wildcard** machine and then run your solver through the internal VPN.

ssh p0ng@10.133.70.3

passwd: p0ngpwned1337

**Instructions**:

**Player 1** == Upper bar

**Player 2** == Lower bar


"**<-"** and "**->**" keys control Player 1

"**4**" and "**6**" keys to use Player 1's combo


"**a**" and "**d**" keys control Player 2

"**z**" and "**c**" keys to use Player 2's combo


Run the game in fullscreen mode so there are no issues.

Good luck! ;)
