Our team got access to this malware, and we believe a modified version of it was used to infect a BloodSuckers server by an unidentified group. Analyze this malware, get access to the C&C and then pwn the server that's running it. Finally, find and exfiltrate any **Important Files** in the server and submit the flag in the format '**CTF-BR{md5sum-of-important-file}**'
