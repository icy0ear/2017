For the infiltration, Case and Molly had to deal with the brain chip's electronics, which was extremely difficult to analyze. In order to pull this off, they asked you to help them calculate the equivalent resistance of a connection between two given weld spots, given the chip's description. The input is composed of an initial description of the circuit, where in each line the first two integers indicate the two points(weld spots) of a connection and the third indicates the resistance of such connection. For the following lines you must answer each one with another line containing only one number (with 3-digit precision), indicating the equivalent resistance of the connection between the two given weld spots.

**e.g.:**

Input:

1 2 1

2 3 1

1 2

2 3

1 3

Output:

1.000

1.000

2.000
