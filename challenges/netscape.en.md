New career opportunities were issued by Butcher Corp in response to the late NCSDs. We believe this is directly related to the recent leak of sensitive data that occured within the company. Given the circumstances, we require new agents to infiltrate into the Corporation's ranks, but keep in mind this is no easy task. We assessed that the application process is now being reviewed by an AI capable of running background checks and doing heuristic analysis as part of the vetoeing. We need you to hijack and get hold of the AI's approval mechanism. Do whatever you must to ensure that your mission will be successful.
