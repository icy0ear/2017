Our agents found a BSC server which is used to contact one of the Corp's sysadmins. We managed to get his IP (45.77.146.27), but we still haven't found it's domain. After obtaining the domain, we believe it's possible to exploit their website somehow, and then obtain sensitive data. Use your old school pentesting skills and you will be rewarded!
