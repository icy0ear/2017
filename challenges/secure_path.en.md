Case was walking around the company when he found what seemed to be an "electrified maze". At that moment he heard a strange noise behind him and out of reflex jumped into the maze. Just as he had stepped in though, the walls behind him closed, leaving him nowhere to go but into the maze. It was a trap. At the wall to his side there was a map of the maze with instructions:

The maze is electrified. This map indicates the electric resistance in each path that connects two rooms. If you are able to reach the other side alive, we will be waiting for you, and your punishment. In 10 minutes the power will be turned on. You only have one chance of leaving it in one piece (and meeting us in the other side).

Case, not really worrying about what he would do whenever he reached the other side, quickly figured something. The least dangerous way is the one with the smallest current. Even though it was just an estimation, Case thought it would be worth a shot going through the path with the smaller resistance being the biggest possible, since he didn't have much time to think of a better plan.

Inside the security room, the coorporation directors watched the attraction of the day, hoping that Case would beat the maze (so they could torture him after). Months earlier, while the maze was being designed, they needed a programmer to determine which way a person should take to get to a destination point from a starting point using Case's strategy (which was correct).

Case, smartly enough, besides escaping the maze and the torture, brought along with him the map of the maze. Now your task is to, after getting a map, compute the safest path between the rooms given.

The input consists of many lines composed of two strings and a numeric value (A B R) describing the map, indicating the eletric resistance between A and B is equal to R. After the map description, come other lines composed of only two characters each. For each of those you must answer with another line containing the names of each vertex in sequence, separated by commas, indicating the path the challenged must take in order to have the highest chance of survival.

**e.g.:**

Input:

1 2 10

2 3 10

1 3 1

1 2

2 3

1 3

Output:

1,2

2,3

1,2,3
